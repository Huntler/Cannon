# StupidEngine Backend
This package includes the backend logic for the StupidEngine. The engine consists of a controller and a game class. The controller should contain the logic of a game and should manage the game class. The game class holds a while-game-runs loop which updates the graphical user interface.

## Controller class
A thread running the logic of a game.

## Game class
The main thread running the pygame update-loop. Here, all sprites will be rendered by passing a game's state.
